Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. And where's my reports? The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. I've gotta go. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you.

C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Yeah, exactly. You got a permit for that?

Oh. George, help me, please. No, not yet. I have to tell you about the future. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.
